# Go Unit Testing Rules

- Use Table-Driven Tests for Error Cases
- Use `stretchr/testify` lib instead of raw comparsion
- Use `testing.T.Cleanup` instead of defer cleanup
- Use `testing.T.Tmpdir` to create tmp dir when necessary

# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.
